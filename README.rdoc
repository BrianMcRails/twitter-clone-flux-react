== README

This application is an MVP twitter 'clone' using Rails, ReactJS, and the flux pattern. Credit for the baseline app goes to Sameer Buna and his pluralsight course "React.js on Rails: Building a Full Stack Web App". 

I have added features after completing the course, and this application could be used as a boilerplate for ReactJS, Rails, and flux on a windows machine.

If you want to use it to quickly get up and running with React in rails, go ahead and clone the repository.
npm install should be enough to get you up and running.
